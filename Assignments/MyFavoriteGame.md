# *Silent Hill 2*
## My Favorite Game
*Silent Hill 2* is my favorite game for many reasons. To me, it is probably one of the best works in the genre of psychological horror. A great mystery is given at the start of the game to ensure my commitment to completing the journey. The foggy atmosphere is haunting with the trip-hop soundtrack complementing it in a unique way. The combat and movement is clunky and frustrating, which heightens my anxiety when encountering the various enemies. I also enjoy the riddles and puzzles throughout the different maps. The payoff of the story is emotional, and playing again for different endings and new items is really fun.
